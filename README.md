# Air-Quality-Analysis-using-Big-Data-Analytics

## About the project 
Air pollution is currently one of the most serious issues plaguing all nations today. In light of this, we examined the air quality data of a few Indian states to uncover underlying principles or patterns that may give insight into the severity of the problem. A data-driven approach is used, leveraging Big Data Analytics technologies.
 
 ### Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to collect data pertaining to the determinants of the analysis of the air pollution level of five different states in India during the years 2008-2012 and thereafter calculate and generate reports on the same based on the real time data collected. The determinants for the analysis of the air pollution level are:

-	Population density of the states (persons/sq km)
-	Percentage of birth and death rate of the people living in a state
-	Count of vehicles owned per family
-	Count of industries in the state
-	Count of people admitted in the hospital due to air borne diseases
-	The total area covered by forests in a state (sq km)
- The concentration of particulate matter in the air (NO₂,SO₂,PM)
